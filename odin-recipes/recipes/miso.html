  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This miso soup is full of savory flavors. Add more dashi to your soup if you want a stronger stock. You can use yellow, white, or red miso paste for this soup â€” yellow miso is sweet and creamy, red miso is stronger and saltier.</p>
    <p>The assembled lasagna should take about 50 minutes to cook in an oven preheated to 375 degrees F. Cover it with foil for the first 25 minutes, then let it cook uncovered for the final 25 minutes. Also, it's important to let the lasagna rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes before you cut into it.</p>

      <li>4 cups water</li>

      <li>2 green onions, sliced diagonally into 1/2 inch pieces</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
